## Executive Summary

**La5asni** is a cutting-edge tool for transforming unstructured training documents (PDF, DOCX) into structured, digestible learning content. It uses AI to generate summaries, key learning points, suggested training modules, and training plans. The tool supports both **Arabic** and **English**, allowing for versatile use across different linguistic needs. La5asni is ideal for trainers, consultants, and course designers who aim to streamline the content creation process and integrate with Learning Management Systems (LMS).

## Problem Statement

Training materials are often stored in static, unstructured document formats, making it difficult to analyze or convert them into effective training programs. Manual interpretation of such documents is time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a clear gap in AI-powered tools capable of automating this transformation efficiently and at scale.

## Project Objectives

* **Automatic Document Analysis**: Analyze training documents (PDF, DOCX) for content extraction.
* **AI-Generated Summaries**: Provide concise summaries of the content.
* **Key Learning Points**: Extract learning objectives and insights from the content.
* **Training Modules**: Suggest training modules with time estimates.
* **Language Support**: Automatically detect and process content in Arabic and English.
* **Training Plan**: Generate auto/manual training plans based on document content.
* **Export Features**: Enable export of results as branded PDF reports.
* **LMS Compatibility**: Prepare for LMS-compatible outputs (SCORM/xAPI).

## Target Users

* **Corporate Trainers**: Quickly convert training manuals into structured training programs.
* **Instructional Designers**: Save time in blueprinting courses and developing learning paths.
* **Educational Consultants**: Efficiently repurpose and refine existing content for various clients.
